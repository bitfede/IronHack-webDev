## Rails workflow ##

ROUTES -> CONTROLLER (class) -> ACTION (method) -> VIEW [Only if it's a GET]

	
Actions:

	index 	- list of books
		[ GET /books ]

	new 	- form for creation
		[GET /books/new]

	create	- receiving the form submission
		[POST /books]

	show 	- displays the details of a book 
		[GET /books/:id]

	edit	- form for editing
		[GET /books/57/edit]

	update	- receives form submission
		[PATCH /books/:id]

	destroy - deletes a book record
		[DELETE /books/57]



when to use plural/singular

	Controller 	-> Plural
		ex: BooksController <- rails generate controller books

	Model		-> Singular
		ex: Book Model
	Table 		-> Plural
		ex: create_table :books


---misc notes

	when rails generates a model, basically a model Model_name is created, which inherits the ActiveBase class.
	ActiveBase lets you query and play with the DB.
	All methods are covered in the ActiveBase docs


---incomplete - look at nizar github to check

	resources books, only: ["new", "create"]
	resources books , only: [
